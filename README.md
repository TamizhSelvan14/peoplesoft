- Git

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone repo_https
   cd peoplesoft
   ```

2. **Create PostgreSQL database:**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE peoplesoft_db;
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   
   Create `backend/.env` file:
   ```env
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_USER=postgres
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   DB_NAME=peoplesoft_db
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   PORT=8080
   ```

4. **Install dependencies and run:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   go mod tidy
   go run main.go
   ```

   Backend will start at: `http://localhost:8080`

5. **Seed the database (optional):**
   ```bash
   # Run the seed file to populate with test data
   psql -U postgres -d peoplesoft_db -f complete-seed-with-hash.sql
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to frontend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables:**
   
   Create `frontend/.env` file:
   ```env
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
   ```

3. **Install dependencies and run:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

   Frontend will start at: `"https://d1coettjn7fksr.cloudfront.net/"`

### Docker Setup (Alternative)

Run backend and database with Docker Compose:

```bash
cd backend
docker compose up --build
```

Then run the frontend separately as shown above.

## 🔑 Test Credentials
